<h1>Top 5 Movies According To Luke</h1>

<h2>My top 5 Movies of all time</h2>

    <hr />

    <h3>1. Shrek</h3>

    <p>Shrek is love, Shrek is life. Need i say more?</p>

    <h3>2. The Avengers</h3>

    <p>who can argue with me that the first avengers movie isnt a straight banger? Its got everything a movie lover could want. From aliens to love and romance, action and adventure. This will always go down in the books for me as one of the greats.</p>
    
    <h3>3. Pacific rim 1/2</h3>

    <p>Who doesnt want to see huge mechs against alien like creatures from a planet far far away? (see what i did there?) Aswell as a kickass love story romance inbetween all the chaos? Pure gold i tell you.</p>
    
    <h3> 4. Lilo and Stitch</h3>

    <p>This one hits close to home. An adorble alien getting adopted but a hawian islander girl and they become best friends and save the galaxy. Orgasmic movie i tell you. (shiii i really got a thing for aliens)</p>
   
    <h3> 5. Pirates of the Caribbean 1/2/3/4/5/6 </h3>

    <p>A swash buckling haliriuos charming pirate daring the seas and what lurks beneath. All the while being comedic, with amazing story telling, and love across the 7 seas while deadly foes chase after the legendary Captain Jack Sparrow. If this isnt on your list your dead to me</p>
